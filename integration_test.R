# This is a crude integration test for the jasmines/rosemary packages.
# the idea is that the "images" folder contains canonical versions
# of the images, created by an earlier version of jasmines/rosemary.
# We then run `rosemary::build_all(clean = TRUE)` to build new versions
# in the "temp" folder. If the images have remained stable I assume
# that the new version of jasmines/rosemary hasn't broken anything.
# At some point I'll write proper    unit tests... sigh.

# build all takes time
#rosemary::build_all(clean = TRUE)

# yeah, yeah, it's not robust...
